### Project Context

In this project, you are provided with a ticket system database with ticket sales event table. This table tracks all ticket sales for various events, including when
a third-party reseller submits their records of ticket sales for a new day. The records are submitted as a CSV file.

With this-mini project, you’ll practice Python and SQL skills by creating a basic data pipeline. You’ll learn how to use the Python database connector to perform data loading and query
databases programmatically.

__Your task is to:__

- Write the table definition DDL and use it to create the sales table.
- Read the CSV file and load the new sales records into the ticket sales table.


### Project Deliverables:

- Push the Python code to your GitHub repo.
- Add a readme file to include steps to run your code and verify the result.
- Attach the command line execution log for the successful job run. You can capture it in a text file.
